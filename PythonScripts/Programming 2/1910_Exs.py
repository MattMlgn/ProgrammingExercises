# Write a function that gets an int number(n) as an input and prints all the ints smaller or equal to n that are perfect squares(x is a perfect square if it exists an int y so that x == y*y). The function returns the highest number printed.
# Write a function that gets an int number(n) as an input and prints all the ints smaller or equal to n that are powers of 2. The function returns the highest number printed.
# Write a function that gets two int numbers(a and b) as input and returns the sum of all odd numbers within the range(a and b included).
# Write a function that gets an int number(n) as an input and prints all its factors. The function returns the number of factors printed. For example, if n is 150, the function will print 2, 3, 5, 5.
