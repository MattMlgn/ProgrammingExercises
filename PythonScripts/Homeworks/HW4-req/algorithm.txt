def computeFile(filename: str):
    This function takes in input a string that contains the relative path of a file, and returns a tuple(str, [str])
    This function simply extract the first row of the file, that we know is the next file's path, and a list containing
    all the words in the file.

def computeFolder(start: str) -> list[str]:
    This function takes in input a string that represent the starting file of the test, and returns a list containing
    all the words of all the files in the starting folder, using a loop and the previous function.

def mostFrequent(lst: list[str]) -> str:
    This is a function that uses a dictionary approach to find the most frequent char in a list.

def most_frequent_chars(filename: str) -> str:
    This is the main function, that uses all the other functions, basically the functions computes the folder of the 
    starting file, using the computeFolder() func. Then tries to find the most frequent char in every position of the words
    using a for loop that iterate for the length of the bigger word.
